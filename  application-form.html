<!-- Make an HTML page, application-form.html, with a form that asks the user:

Their first and last name (as separate fields),
Their salary requirement as a number, and
Which job they are applying for, from a list of:
Software Engineer
QA Engineer
Product Manager
It should also have a submit button that submits the form to the URL /application. This should be a POST request.

It should have a large heading and some explanatory text. -->
